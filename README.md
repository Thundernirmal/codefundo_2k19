# blockchain Voting App

This web app will give the voter options to check different aspects of candidate personality and the blockchain technology will help us make sure that each person votes exactly once and that vote, once casted, be unchangeable.


We intend to provide voter with quick links(which will show the candidate's promises and other imp aspects ) along with candidate name so that the voter can make an informed choice. To make sure that each person votes exactly once and it is unalterable, we create a voting system that makes sure that  each vote is recorded one time(by using a token(which is equivalent to a vote)) for the specific candidate they want(the token(vote) will be placed in candidate's wallet) and will be permanently recorded on the blockchain.

We also have built in additional capabilities that will allow for people to voice their opinions on various topics, enhancing the “voice of the people” approach of the web app.
